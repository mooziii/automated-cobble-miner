# automated-cobble-miner
A nice and simple mod for fabric & quilt that automaticially mines blocks at a given position. Quite useful for skyblock or any cobblestone generators.

This mod only requires the fabric api to run, just place both files into your mods folder **OR** install them using [pacmc](https://github.com/jakobkmar/pacmc/):

`pacmc install automated-cobble-miner`

Once it is installed, aim at a block and press the hotkey (default: M) to toggle mining.
